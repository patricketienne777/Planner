Hello!
This week's assignment is dedicated to building a planner for the user's day to day activities! 
This web page allows it's visitors to plan out their day by keeping track of their planned activities and organized them based on 
the time they're scheduled to occur. The planner also labels the events as past present and future, using colors, to display the user's 
progress.

I had a lot of fun putting this project together and applying new slices of information and combining them with the foundation 
of what I've learned.
